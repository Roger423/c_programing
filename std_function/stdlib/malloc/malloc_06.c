1. Return Value
Most implementations of malloc() (including glibc) return a NULL pointer when the size is 0. This is because 
malloc(0) is considered an invalid request for memory allocation, as it doesnâ€™t make sense to allocate "zero" bytes.

In some systems, however, malloc(0) might return a non-NULL pointer. This is generally a valid but 
implementation-dependent behavior, and such pointers are typically considered to be "unique" but not usable 
for accessing memory. If a non-NULL pointer is returned, dereferencing it leads to undefined behavior.

2. Standard Explanation
The C standard (ISO/IEC 9899) states that:

If the size is 0, malloc() may either return a NULL pointer or a unique pointer. In both cases, the pointer should 
not be dereferenced.

The important part is that calling free() on a pointer returned by malloc(0) is safe. The free() function will handle 
it without any issues, regardless of whether the pointer is NULL or non-NULL.

3. Behavior of free() with Zero-Byte Allocations
It is safe to call free() on a pointer that was returned by malloc(0). If the pointer is NULL (either explicitly 
or implicitly), free() does nothing. If the pointer is non-NULL (but the size allocated is zero), free() will still 
properly release the memory, even though the allocation is zero bytes.

Key Takeaways:
1. malloc(0) may return either a NULL pointer or a non-NULL pointer, depending on the system's implementation of 
   malloc(). On Linux systems with glibc, it's more common to return a non-NULL pointer for malloc(0).
2. Dereferencing a pointer returned by malloc(0) is undefined behavior, and you should avoid using the pointer for 
   any memory access.
3. free() on a malloc(0) pointer is safe.
