# Fundamental (Primitive) Data Types
## Integer Types

These represent whole numbers (positive, negative, or zero) without fractional parts. Their size and range depend on 
the system's architecture (typically 32-bit or 64-bit) and the specific implementation (e.g., compiler and platform).

### int
1. Description: The default integer type, typically 4 bytes (32 bits) on modern systems, 
   but can vary (e.g., 2 bytes on some older systems).

2. Range: Typically -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 (for 32-bit, signed).

3. Unsigned variant: unsigned int (0 to 4,294,967,295 for 32-bit).

### short (or short int)
1. Description: A shorter integer, typically 2 bytes (16 bits).

2. Range: -32,768 to 32,767 (signed); 0 to 65,535 (unsigned, unsigned short).
